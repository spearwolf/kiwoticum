# kiwoticum

kiwoticum is a game project created by myself just for fun.

![](./images/kiwoticum-prototype-js-shot0.jpg)

it's _unfinished_ and __work-in-progress__ since 2011 -- but I always come back to it ;-)

there are two none-interactive demos:

-   [SVG prototype of world-map creation](http://spearwolf.github.io/kiwoticum/)
-   [WebGL version](http://spearwolf.github.io/kiwoticum/threejs.html)

the kiwoticum code is licensed under the GPLv3. see [LICENSE](./LICENSE.txt) for details.
